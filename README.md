# se-post-sales-assistant

*Post Sales Assistant is a Webex Teams bot tailor-made for SE's to provide them with a personal assistant for building successful customer relationships after a sale has been made.*


## Business/Technical Challenge

As Systems Engineers in the Americas, we understand that our relationship with our customers extends beyond the close of a deal. We have a role to play in the customer's journey with our solutions - all the way from pre sales through post sales. While we do our best to keep up with customers after a sale, checking up on customers after a sale can be a difficult but worthwhile effort. 

Once equipment and solutions are received, a key question arises as to whether or not the customer is even using all that we provided to them. In addition, as trusted advisors our customers reach out to us when situations arise because they believe we as Cisco engineers can facilitate resolution.

In other words, timely responses from SE's with regards to post sales engagements ensures a world class experience for our customers!


## Proposed Solution

Our solution to this challenge is a personal assistant available to any and all SE's: Post Sales Assistant. 
Post Sales Assistant is a Webex Teams Bot with integrations into CCW for sale-related information and into the TAC case management backend for information regarding any service requests.

On the proactive front, the bot will message a SE after a given elapsed time has passed since a deal closed. This will facilitate the process of to reaching out and engaging with a customer in order to ensure that their solutions are in place and that they are realizing the value of choosing Cisco. The bot will also enable SE's to schedule reminders about future touch points as needed.

On the reactive front, the bot can be used to pull pertinent information regarding a customer SR such as last activity, engineer assigned, and current status as well as enable a SE to receive ongoing notifications while the case remains open.
